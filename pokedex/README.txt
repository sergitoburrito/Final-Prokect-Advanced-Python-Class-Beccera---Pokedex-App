Hello Professor Beccera In order for my app to work you have to run it from the gui_app.py file
simply view the file and press run
or you can run it on terminal by using this, i think itll work but essesitally itll be cd Dowloads\pokedex py gui_app.py
and boom you should have it up and running
note the spelling of the names is a bit important so make sure you dont misspell
here are some names to try: Pikachu, Charizard, Lopunny, Hatterene, Gengar, Alakazam, Mewtwo, Zoroark, and Greninja
\thx hope you liek my project
